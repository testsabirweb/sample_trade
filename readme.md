# Algo Trading Custom Strategy Implementation (Upstox)

This project helps traders implement their custom strategies for algorithmic trading using Python. The repository includes a basic structure to get started with your own trading algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/testsabirweb/sample_trade.git
    cd sample_trade
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Setup

1. Create a `my_secrets.py` file in the root directory of the project with the following content `(upstox only)`:
    ```python
    CLIENT_ID = "your CLIENT_ID"
    SECRET_KEY = "your SECRET_KEY"
    FY_ID = "your FY_ID"
    TOTP_KEY = "your TOTP_KEY"
    PIN = "your PIN"
    REDIRECT_URI = "your REDIRECT_URI"
    ```

### Running the Project

Run the main script to start your algorithmic trading strategy:
```bash
python main.py
```
